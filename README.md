## Coding Examples
This repo showcases project code for projects I have worked on independently.

*All of the code in this repository is proprietary and not to be shared without written consent by the repo owner and code writer*

**The Folders of this repo contain the following:**

### Melton Scholars
 * Contains two example files of code utilized in the analysis and cleaning of my Senior research project.
 * The files showcase my work and utilization of various functions to answer various questions posed by the stakeholders. 
 * These files allowed us to answer important factors that drive fan decision making when purchasing tickets as well as estimating importance of the variables to driving final price differences in the resale market vs the primary market

### Women's Soccer
  * Contains analysis of player performance metric generated with Principal Component Analysis for a women's soccer team. The code works through the data to determine the necessary weights for the main drivers of an athlete's performance.
  * Also included is the code to generate the shiny app/dashboard that displays the resulting player performance metric across a date range.
  * The neurtyping analysis comepleted on the athlete's after they completed a survery. The code and pdf for this analysis provided an ability to identify the main neurotype of each athlete. This was used along with the player performance to better understand and design practice plans throughout the year to maximize player outputs during games.
