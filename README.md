# Coding Challenges Repository
This repo showcases project code for various job application challenges I have had the opportunity to work on as well as code for projects I have worked on independently.

*All of the code in this repository is proprietary and not to be shared without written consent by the repo owner and code writer*

**The Folders of this repo contain the following:**

### Driveline
  * Conatins the .txt file of answers to a survey provided as part of my research and development analyst intern application. The file includes both the questions and answers for all of the questions. SQL code to query a sample database and analysis of a pitcher are included in the survey answers, images to support my answers are included in the folder as well.

### Kansas City Royals
  * Contains the coding and pdf writeup for the technical assessment as part of my application process for the analyst position with research and development.
  * The coding_challenge.Rmd file, and pdf, contains code to develop a model to determine the probability of scoring on a tag-up play
  * The Go_NoGo folder contains code and models to generate a dashboard to assist in decision making on whether or not to send a runner. The app also grades outfielders on a three teir scale (similar to a stoplight) of whether you can run against them. A 20-80 scale grade is also included in the dashboard.

### Melton Scholars
 * Contains two example files of code utilized in the analysis and cleaning of my Senior undergraduate research project.
 * The files showcase my work and utilization of various functions to answer various questions posed by the stakeholders. 
 * These files allowed us to answer important factors that drive fan decision making when purchasing tickets as well as estimating importance of the variables to driving final price differences in the resale market vs the primary market

### Milwaukee Brewers
  * Contains the coding and pdf writeup for the technical assessment as part of my application process for the research and development analytics position. The files contain a description of the questions asked and are answered below in the same file.

### New York Yankees
  * Contains the coding and pdf for the technical assessment as part of my application process for the biomechanics analyst postion. The files contain a decription of the questions asked and are answered below in the same file.

### Philadelphia Phillies
  * Contains the coding and pdf for the technical assessment as part of my application process for the associate quantitative analyst position. 
  * Part A focuses on my approach to answering a question asked by our Major League Infield Coach, the question can be found in the files.
  * Part B focuses on developing a model to predict full season batting average based on the performance of batters in March/April

### Rapsodo
  * Contains the coding and pdf for the technical assessment as part of my application process for a data analytics intern position.
  * This task centered around developing a new classification approach for batted balls different from the current approach utilized by Rapsodo.

### Seattle Mariners
  * Contains the coding process for the tecnical assessemnt as part of my application for the research and development analytics position.
  * Included are pdf writeups for various stakeholders utilizing the results of my coded model and process.
  * Also there is a writeup of two questions asked during the technical interview process.

### Tampa Bay Rays
  * Contains the coding for the questionnaire survey I was asked to take (scratch code.r) focuesed on answering questions surrounding probability.
  * Also contains the coding and pdf for the technical assessment as part of my application process for a research and development analyst position. The files will contain a comparison of two batted ball tracking systems. Once the comparison was completed I was tasked with predicting next season's speed-off-bat metric for all of the hitters provided in the dataset.

### Women's Soccer
  * Contains analysis of player performance metric generated with Principal Component Analysis for a women's soccer team. The code works through the data to determine the necessary weights for the main drivers of an athlete's performance.
  * Also included is the code to generate the shiny app/dashboard that displays the resulting player performance metric across a date range.
  * The neurtyping analysis comepleted on the athlete's after they completed a survery. The code and pdf for this analysis provided an ability to identify the main neurotype of each athlete. This was used along with the player performance to better understand and design practice plans throughout the year to maximize player outputs during games.
